- When you do make summary documents, put them as markdown files with mermaid graphs in the ./docs directory
- Do not need to create summary documents unless I ask
- When adding new dependencies, libraries or technologies, do web searches to verify you are using the latest versions
- Do not use emojis
- Do not write api endpoints with try-catches that fail silently. Let errors bubble up
- Try to limit functions to no more than 50 lines
